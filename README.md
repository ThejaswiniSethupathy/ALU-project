# ALU-project

This 3-bit ALU performs a variety of arithmetic, bitwise, logical, and reduction operations based on a 4-bit selection (sel) input.

ðŸ”¹ Features of this ALU:
âœ… Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
âœ… Bitwise Operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and NAND.
âœ… Logical Operations: AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
âœ… Reduction Operators: AND (&), OR (|), and XOR (^).
âœ… Division by Zero Handling: If b = 0 during division (a / b) or modulo (a % b), the ALU prevents undefined behavior by assigning a safe value.
